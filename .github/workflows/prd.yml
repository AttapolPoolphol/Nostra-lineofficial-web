  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build
        run: |
          yarn
          sudo yarn global add gatsby-cli
          GATSBY_ACTIVE_ENV=production gatsby build
